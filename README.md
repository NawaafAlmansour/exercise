This is a repository for keeping my own exercise works, somethimes tiny projects. In this git I keep my most recent works, tasks and even everything. This is not educative. But if anyone want to see and gather knowledge from this git then it will be a  pleasure for me. 
I always try to commit here which I make changed. This git is totally reusable. Anyone can take code from this git and use for his own purpose. 

Sometimes this git may contain some codes with bug. Before using in your project please be sure that "This is working well"; 
If you find any wrong or any bugs you can simply pull a request for changing. This will be helpful for me to make correction as soon as possible. 

If anybody wants to participate in this git then he/she is highly welcome. Simply mail my arif98741@gmail.com
